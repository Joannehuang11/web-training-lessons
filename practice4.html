        <h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>My diverse academic experience has aroused my interest in the interaction of emotional psychology, socialism, and architecture. During the Cornell in Rome program, the serene beams from the Pantheon's oculus astounded me by demonstrating that impetuosity transcends class boundaries. Everyone unintentionally calmed down after walking into the Pantheon from the bustling piazza. I did nothing but stare at the disc of light, feeling the time fly by the coffers and becoming emotionally empty. Backpacking in Europe, the scattered columns in the Krematorium Baumschulenweg similarly astonished me: It embraces all emotions while offering personal shelter. As the cenotaph's center is an intermediary for rituals, I glimpsed a family greeting, heard a woman weeping behind a column, and realized that all sentiments find their spaces in this remedial cenotaph. I have come to solidly believe that architecture has a significant impact on mental well-being.</p>

        <p>In the internship at <span class="highlight">Atelier Tekuto</span> in Tokyo, I recognized people's unaware sentimental disorder. As most people must work amid capitalism all day long, spiritual lives are often deemphasized. People tend to waste time at the office even as they complete their tasks; people pass out in the metro instead of taking a taxi home. Accurately said, people lose sentimental perception. My undergraduate thesis investigated obscure mental needs with drawings and poems to indicate this sickness and offer a remedy. Eventually, I proposed an experimental office building in which Japan's rigid companies coexist with third spatial healing areas. I designed the entrance hall as a sunset observatory and the patio as a sunlight clock, hoping that people regain autonomy to navigate their lives.</p>
    
        <p>During my working time, I have strengthened my professional skills. After my undergraduate studies, I started to work in my thesis supervisor's practice, Yo Shawn Shieh Architects, and gained rival skills as a practitioner. First, I have become a persuasive communicator and group worker. I participated in a 340-dwelling public housing project, for which we designed a continuously surrounding balcony to connect outside maximally, offering outdoor space to rest. However, due to budgetary constraints, the client rejected our proposal. After intensive discussion with the technicians and consultants, we created a better layout while fulfilling our concept, reaching a consensus with our clients. Second, I have become a lucid orator. Representing our firm, I gave a public speech to share our concept and the achievement of reaching common ground with the client. Third, I have developed a persistent focus on achieving my goals when faced with challenges. On top of that, the self-discipline to learn autonomously significantly enhances these three skills and help me earn my professional license. In three years, I have rapidly improved my competencies and become well-prepared for professional practice.</p>
    
        <p>Besides my substantial practice experience, I have also elevated my motivation for further study during my working time. Apart from the architecture cases, I chaired nine startup office designs, including a social media working space and a communal office. In the communal office case, the creative working way has widened my recognition of office prototypes. We created a consumerized office for particular user functions and time. Expressly, the user can reserve places of multiple sizes, with a list of specific demands. After that experience, I quickly realized that perhaps a meeting room or a toilet could be temporarily disguised as a sleeping room or a game room for mental rest. With more observation, my inspirations call for new thinking frameworks to pursue my ideally remedial architecture.</p>
    
        <p>To complement my academic and professional time, I engage in various leisure pursuits and learning through ongoing and broad-ranging study. Having been a volleyball team leader for three years in college, I have comprehended that pursuing victory creates belonging, mental relief, and therapy. From psychology, especially Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom, I recognize that people feel trapped due to a lack of self-reflection. From socialism, I realize that substantial life is manipulated to stabilize social hierarchy, destroying spiritual lives. Also, drawing enables me to record my daily reflections. All in all, I make the greatest use of leisure time to pave the way for my goal by learning widely and studying incessantly.</p>
    
        <p>UTSOA would be a truly inspiring place to pursue my dreams. It capitalizes on the U.S.'s receptive nature for experimental architecture and builds on this with the intensive and discipline-wide courses to practice. Most of all, the program is accurately what I strongly require, allowing me to achieve my first professional degree in the U.S. Even having practiced solidly in Taiwan for three years, adventure in architecture in another country is a severe challenge. Therefore, a tough 2-year professional training supports me to reach my goal- work with the U.S. practice. "Site Design" helps me understand the U.S. siting strategies, while "Professional Practice" allows me, an international student, to learn how to practice in the U.S comprehensively. Moreover, many design studio's subjects perfectly align with my passion. The 2020 fall's "Architecture and the PERIPATETIC 2" reveals the city with the re-defined itinerary, supplementing my view with my favorite way- walking on the street.  </p>
    
        <p>Given my profound interest in architecture's mental-healing power and recognition of your program's quality, I hope you will favorably consider my application to your prestigious program.</p>
